  I am a data scientist based in Athens, Greece. My name is John koufopoulos, and I am a 
  dedicated and passionate data scientist with a robust background in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. 
  With a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python and R, and extensive experience in data manipulation tools like 
  Pandas and NumPy, I am adept at extracting, transforming, and analyzing complex datasets. My proficiency in machine learning 
  libraries such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch allows me to develop predictive models that drive actionable insights 
  and inform strategic decisions.
