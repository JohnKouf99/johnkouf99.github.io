# My portofolio
Hello, my name is John Koufopoulos, a passionate and dedicated data scientist with a strong foundation in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. My passion for extracting knowledge from intricate datasets and applying that knowledge to address pressing issues in society is what motivates me to pursue a career in data science.

# Project in machine learning
* Given an imdb dataset, extract infromation and discover various trends about movie genres and titles and users preferences
* Utilize clustering algorithms such as Kmeans and DBSCAN
* Utilize classifiers such as Naive Bayes and MLP, make comparrisons using various visualization tools and graphs, and reach into conlcusions
* Clean, transform and join various datasets to achieve the desired results
* Visualize the results using the seaborn and matplot library

# Project in deep learning
* Utilize deep learning methods and techniques to generate and analyse results regarding the CIC-IDS2017 dataset
* The CIC-IDS2017 dataset is a comprehensive and widely-used dataset in the field of cybersecurity, particularly for the development and evaluation of intrusion detection systems (IDS).

# Project in visual analytics
* Given a dataset regarding AirBnB listings and reservations, I explored, cleaned and transformed complex data into viual comprehensible insights.
* Unncovered patterns, and generated hypotheses.
* Identified trends, correlations, and anomalies within the data.

# Time series project
* Utilize the M4 competition dataset (Makridakis, S., Spiliotis, E. and Assimakopoulos, V., 2020. The M4 Competition: 100,000 time series and 61 forecasting methods. International Journal of Forecasting, 36(1), pp.54-74.)
* Given the above dataset, we generate prediction on montly, quarterly, and yearly time series
* Utilize tensorflow.keras libraries to implement prediction models
* Utilize traditional ARIMA and Naive bayes models
* Future values are calculated using both the Point Intervals (PIs) and Point Forecasts (PFs) techniques

# Vehicle routing problem
* We aim to solve the VRP problem, utilizing pythons DOcplex library
* DOcplex is a Python library developed by IBM that provides an interface for optimization modeling and solving.

# Steiners Tree Problem
* We try to solve the steiners tree problem
* Utilize pythons dictionaries to represent nodes and edges on the tree

# Social Network Analysis
* This assignment focuses on the algorithmic manipulation of the StackOver-ï¬‚ow TemporalNetwork, whose description and related dataset may be found at (https://snap.stanford.edu/data/sx-stackoverflow.html)
* Utilize networkx library to generate graphs, nodes and edges, and calculate various metrics
